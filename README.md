# Test
Ruby interface and circle class implementation

## Ruby version
Ruby 2.4.1

## Draw method implementation
Actually the draw method draw a circle shape in the console output.
For a HTML implementation it could be used the next libraries:
*  RMagic
* Processing: https://www.sitepoint.com/drawing-processing-ruby/

With HTML5 and  its new features it is possible draw this shapes in a easy way.
Another perspective is add the parameters  x:axis, y:axis, width, heigh. With this parameters is posible add a draw functionality into a front end module. Actually the code drew a circle in the terminal passing only the radius of a required cirlce.

## Run the test

Open a new terminal 
go to the project path
run the next command

´´
rspec
